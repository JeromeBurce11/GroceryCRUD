     "write_up":"Bukidnon is witness to varying degrees of acculturation of its people. The first-degree Bukidnons are those leading the most traditional lifestyle and those whose parents are full-blooded natives. They are those who lived remote from any access of lowlander influence, deep in the forest and along the watershed areas and the main rivers. The second-degree Bukidnons live near the fringes of the forests and directly within the bounds of the lowlanders. The third-degree Bukidnons are highly assimilated natives and are generally able to send their children off to school. The fourth-degree Bukidnons have fully assimilated the ways of urban living and hardly acknowledge the old ways of their background. The fifth-degree Bukidnons are largely recent immigrants from other parts of the Philippine archipelago and have made Bukidnon as their permanent home."
